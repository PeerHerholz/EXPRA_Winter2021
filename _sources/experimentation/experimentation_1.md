# Experimentation I
Within the eigth session we'll focus solely on the `demo experiment` and its `analysis` to pave the way for the `demo experiment reports` and the transition to your `research experiments` where you'll use the same experiment framework (stimulus set, paradigm, online platform) to address your own hypotheses using the analyzes we discussed and went through in `R`. 

## Topics 💡👨🏻‍🏫 

In the following you'll find the `objectives` and `materials` for each of the topics we'll discuss during this session.

### Experimentation I - the demo experiment in more depth
We already talked a bit about the `demo experiment` but there's still quite a bit of information missing to actually understand it in more detail and write the `demo experiment report`. Within this session we will try to address the missing pieces, specifically: what are these "representations" again, how can we compare them the models we assumed, what are the statistical analyzes involved there and how can we interpret the respective outcomes?

#### Objectives📍

- Learn about more about the demo experiment
- finish the analyzes and learn how to interpret outcomes
- Ask and answer questions
- Have a great time


#### Materials📓

## Demo project related work 🥼🧑🏽‍💻🧑🏾‍💻  

As mentioned above, we'll continue to work on the `demo experiment`, this going into the details regarding the statistical analyzes and try to finish our `R` script so that y'all can work in the corresponding aspects of the `demo experiment report`.

## Project related work 🥼🧑🏿‍🔬👩🏻‍🔬

Start thinking about hypotheses you would like to investigate using the experiment framework and analyzes of the demo experiment. Potentially, share your ideas with the rest of the course and try to build groups based on common ideas/interests. 

## tasks for subsequent meeting 🖥️✍🏽📖

### demo project 

You should continue to work on things related to your `demo experiment report`, including `finding/organizing & reading publications`, `data management plan` and `pre-registration` outside standard course hours. Additionally, you should try to incorporate the things we discussed in this session into your `demo experiment report` draft and start writing more precise drafts, including all sections.
