# Experimentation II
Within the ninth session we'll focus solely on the `research experiments` and their `setup` to pave the way for the respective transition to more independent work where you'll use the same experiment framework (stimulus set, paradigm, online platform) to address your own hypotheses using the analyzes we discussed and went through in `R`. 

## Topics 💡👨🏻‍🏫 

In the following you'll find the `objectives` and `materials` for each of the topics we'll discuss during this session.

### The future is now - research experiments via online platforms
We already talked a bit about the `experiment` but so far we haven't addressed how it's actually created and hosted. As mentioned before and you already experienced a while back: we will use an `online platform` to run the experiment, specifically [meadows](https://meadows-research.com/). To provide some more insights and a better understanding we will briefly talk about `online experiment` settings, as well as pros/cons and then spend a closer look on how our experiment is setup on `meadows`, including how you can adapt it based on your `research projects`. Importantly, this will also include some guidelines/hints regarding the `research experiment groups` including tasks, outline, deadlines, etc. .

#### Objectives📍

- learn about online platform for experiments
- form research experiment groups
- Ask and answer questions
- Have a great time


#### Materials📓

## Demo project related work 🥼🧑🏽‍💻🧑🏾‍💻  

You did folks, you finished and submitted the `demo experiment report`. Great job and fantastic work, you did really really well!
Thanks for your efforts and interesting questions/discussions regarding this! As mentioned before, we will go back to your `demo experiment reports` after the break and go through them in a very detailed manner. However, for now let's party a bit.

## Project related work 🥼🧑🏿‍🔬👩🏻‍🔬

As mentioned above, the content within the first part of the session should allow you to further brainstorm ideas for your `research question(s)` and how to implement them. Ideally, y'all would build your final `research experiment groups` and further outline the aspects you want to investigate so that we can implement them in the `online experiment platform` and you can start your `data acquisition` asap. Given that this was the final "official" session before the holidays further planning will be done outside the normal course setting via groups getting together with the instructor to answer questions and setting up their own experiment.      

## tasks for subsequent meeting 🖥️✍🏽📖

The tasks for the subsequent meeting are exclusively related to the `research experiment projects`, in that they aim to bring you further within the respective processes. As we almost have a month until the next session (minus the holidays and adjacent days of course), there are actually a few tasks but again they should be conducted anyway within the `research experiment projects` and are hopefully easier this time based on the practice run with the `demo experiment`. 

### OSF project
As for the `demo experiment`, each group should create an `OSF` project for their `research experiment project`, including the same aspects. Thus, you can basically copy-paste most of the `demo experiment OSF project` (e.g., the different integrations, different components, etc.) and just update the description. This also includes the creation of an open `zotero library`.

### Pre-registration
The `pre-registration` should be completed before you start acquiring data to follow real-world settings and the actual idea of a `pre-registration` as closely as possible. Once you have your `research question` and `hypotheses` ready, do the `pre-registration` and get the respective time-stamp. Again, should you have questions, please just ask the instructor. 

### Data management plan
After going through the `demo experiment` in more detail you should have a much better understanding of the `data` you will be `acquiring` and `analyzes` you will be `conducting`. Ideally, the processes of doing the `pre-registration` and writing the `DMP` should go hand in hand and inform one another. As usual, don't hesitate to ask questions!

### Journal club presentations
One part of the `research workflow` is the presentation and discussion of `research ideas`, `hypotheses` and `experiment setups`. To also include this aspect we will have two `journal clubs` within which each `research project group` will present their `ideas` and `hypotheses` in ~` 20 min presentation`, as well as provide feedback for the other `group`s. Importantly, every group member should do a 5 min summary of a paper that was utilized to form the `research questions` and `derive hypotheses`, i.e. prior literature on the topic.
