# Experimentation II
Within the eighth session we'll start our transition from the `demo experiment` to the `research experiment` via talking about and discussing approaches to `experimentation` and `inference`, paving the way to your `research experiments` where you'll use the same experiment framework (stimulus set, paradigm, online platform) to address your own hypotheses using the analyzes we discussed and went through in `R`. 

## Topics 💡👨🏻‍🏫 

In the following you'll find the `objectives` and `materials` for each of the topics we'll discuss during this session.

### Wake me up before you test-test: experimentation & inference
How can one come up with a research questions and once there's one, how can it be investigated? These are questions we'll address in this part of the seminar.  

#### Objectives📍

- learn about theories of experimentation & inference
- hear about analysis levels & types of questions asked within experiment settings
- Ask and answer questions
- Have a great time


#### Materials📓

## Demo project related work 🥼🧑🏽‍💻🧑🏾‍💻  

As mentioned above, we'll continue to work on the `demo experiment`, this going into the details regarding the statistical analyzes and try to finish our `R` script so that y'all can work in the corresponding aspects of the `demo experiment report`.

## Project related work 🥼🧑🏿‍🔬👩🏻‍🔬

Start thinking about hypotheses you would like to investigate using the experiment framework and analyzes of the demo experiment. Potentially, share your ideas with the rest of the course and try to build groups based on common ideas/interests. 

## tasks for subsequent meeting 🖥️✍🏽📖

### demo project 

You should continue to work on things related to your `demo experiment report`, including `finding/organizing & reading publications`, `data management plan` and `pre-registration` outside standard course hours. Additionally, you should try to incorporate the things we discussed in this session into your `demo experiment report` draft and start writing more precise drafts, including all sections.
