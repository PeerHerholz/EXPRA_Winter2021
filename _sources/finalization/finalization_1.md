# Finalization I
With this session, we've reached the last block of the course: `project finalization`. Within it, we will focus on various aspects that usually appear during the final stretches of a scientific research project, including `visualization`, `results presentation` and providing `FAIR` outcomes. We will start with spending some time on two tremendously crucial aspects:     `data visualization` and `scientific posters`.


## Topics 💡👨🏻‍🏫 

In the following you'll find the `objectives` and `materials` for each of the topics we'll discuss during this session.

### A song of data and graphics - a primer on important aspects of visualization 

#### Objectives📍

- discuss approaches to data visualization
- learn about different options to visualize data
- get to know “standards”
- Ask and answer questions
- Have a great time

#### Materials📓

## Demo project related work 🥼🧑🏽‍💻🧑🏾‍💻  

You did folks, you finished and submitted the `demo experiment report`. Great job and fantastic work, you did really really well! Thanks for your efforts and interesting questions/discussions regarding this!


## Project related work 🥼🧑🏿‍🔬👩🏻‍🔬

You should start thinking about and drafting both the `visualizations` and `posters` for your `research experiment`. While the first is rather concerned with how the existing `visualization` can be improved based on the aspects we talked about, the second introduces a new task designing a `poster`. 

## tasks for subsequent meeting 🖥️✍🏽📖

At this point you should focus on your `data analyses` and try to prepare as much as possible for the next session so that we can discuss things accordingly. This includes `downloading` and `converting data`, as well as computing `mean` and `SD` `RDM`s.
