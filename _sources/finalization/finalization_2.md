# Finalization II
With this session, we'll continue to talk about aspects related to `project finalization`. After focusing on `data visualization` and `scientific posters` in the last session, we are going to spend a closer on increasing the `FAIR`ness of our analyzes, i.e. checking how we can provide (somewhat interactive) walkthroughs. Furthermore, we will also recap what the analyses parts of the `research reports` should entail and spend time on conducting the respective analyses.

## Topics 💡👨🏻‍🏫 

In the following you'll find the `objectives` and `materials` for each of the topics we'll discuss during this session.

### Cool story, now show me the data and code - further pointers regarding (reproducible) analyses

#### Objectives📍

- discuss approaches to reproducible analyses
- repeat important analyses steps
- Ask and answer questions
- Have a great time

#### Materials📓

## Demo project related work 🥼🧑🏽‍💻🧑🏾‍💻  

You did folks, you finished and submitted the `demo experiment report`. Great job and fantastic work, you did really really well! Thanks for your efforts and interesting questions/discussions regarding this!


## Project related work 🥼🧑🏿‍🔬👩🏻‍🔬

You should continue to think about and drafting both the `visualizations` and `posters` for your `research experiment`. While the first is rather concerned with how the existing `visualization` can be improved based on the aspects we talked about, the second introduces a new task designing a `poster`. Additionally, you should try to finish as much of the analyses and possible so that we can address potential problems in the last session.

## tasks for subsequent meeting 🖥️✍🏽📖

At this point you should focus on your `data analyses` and try to prepare as much as possible for the next session so that we can discuss things accordingly. Furthermore, you should prepare your `poster presentation` for the last session so that you can showcase your fantastic work!
