# Experimentation III
Within the eleventh session we'll have a split between the `research experiments` and the `demo experiments`. In more detail, we will hear the last two `journal club presentations` and starting reviewing your `demo experiment reports` via the respective feedback that was shared with you. The respective content should help you to further advance with regard to your research experiments, theoretically and practically.  

## Topics 💡👨🏻‍🏫 

There will be no direct "classic" input from the instructor during this session.

## Demo project related work 🥼🧑🏽‍💻🧑🏾‍💻  

After a lot of hard work it's finally time to talk about your `demo experiment reports`. In particular, the instructor will meet with each group to share and discuss the prepared review and feedback in as much detail as possible. This will include an overall summary as well as precise in-line comments throughout your `demo experiment reports`. Both will be provided via a shared doc so that we continue to discuss certain aspects and questions also outside the course hours. 

## Project related work 🥼🧑🏿‍🔬👩🏻‍🔬

Project-related work for this session will comprise the below explained `journal club presentations`. 

### Journal club presentations
As mentioned above, the second part of this week's lecture will entail the first two `journal club presentations` within which each `research project group` will present their `study idea`, including `background information`, `hypotheses` and `methods` in in ~` 20 min`. The rest of the gang will provide as much feedback as possible within shared docs. Importantly, every group member should do a 5 min summary of a paper that was utilized to form the `research questions` and `derive hypotheses`, i.e. prior literature on the topic.     

## tasks for subsequent meeting 🖥️✍🏽📖

The tasks for the subsequent meeting are exclusively related to the `research experiment projects`, in that they aim to bring you further within the respective processes. More precisely, every group should closely monitor their `experiments` and start `analyzing` the `data`, as well as writing their `research experiment reports`. The first few impressions concerning the data acquisition should furthermore be used to think about potential ways to increase the number of participants.
