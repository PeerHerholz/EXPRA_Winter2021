Hello everyone and welcome to the course page for "EXPRA - group 3", taught
within the [Psychology bachelor programme](https://www.goethe-university-frankfurt.de/51789866/Institute_of_Psychology?) of the [Goethe-University Frankfurt](https://www.goethe-university-frankfurt.de/en) during the winter term 2021. We're glad to see you here!

<br/>
    
<div style="text-align: justify"> 

Within these pages, we provide all the information important to follow and conduct the course, including formal aspects, requirements, lecture materials, practicals and so on.  This [jupyter book](https://jupyterbook.org/intro.html) will include the used slides and code in a way that they can be explored in an interactive manner. You can navigate through the respective sections via the TOC on the left side and within sections via the TOC on the right side. The three symbols in the top allow to enable full screen mode, link to the underlying [Github repository]() and allow you to download the contents as a pdf or [jupyter notebook]() respectively. Some sections will additionally have a little rocket in that row which will allow you to interactively rerun certain parts of the practicals via cloud computing. Additionally, we support public reviews and comments through an [hypothes.is]() plugin with which you can interact on the right side. All of this awesomeness (talking about the infrastructure and resource) is possible through the dedicated and second to none work of the [Jupyter community](https://jupyter.org/), specifically, the [Executable/Jupyter Book](https://executablebooks.org/en/latest/) and [mybinder project](https://mybinder.org/).

## EXPRA

No matter the scientific field: obtaining a solid understanding of and gaining substantial hands-on experience with research processes and workflows is crucial, with Psychology being no exception to that. Obviously, not everyone will continue in a research setting after their studies but developing a respective skill set will be beneficial independent of what folks might end doing. Critical thinking & evaluation, research project management, quantitative & qualitative analyses, etc. enable a holistic approach to the generation, preservation and dissemination of knowledge, as well as informed decision making. But how should folks learn these things?

<p align="center"><iframe src="https://giphy.com/embed/sgZdwNkOH43wZOEUJ2" width="240" height="240" frameBorder="0" vspace="0" class="giphy-embed" allowFullScreen></iframe></p><p align="center"><a href="https://giphy.com/gifs/parksandrec-episode-9-parks-and-recreation-rec-sgZdwNkOH43wZOEUJ2"><small>via GIPHY</small></a></p></p>

Traditionally, one way of achieving this is to familiarize students with all parts of the research process early on in their studies with an application to real-world problems and questions. More precisely, folks conduct several experiments, provided and self-chosen, within which they perform all or most of the necessary steps of the research workflow themselves, both in a guided and independent manner. Importantly, all of this will be conducted based on [open science principles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_science). This has several important reasons: addressing the faulty direction science and academia in via changing incentive structures ([open methodology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-notebook_science), [open data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_data), [open access](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_access),[open peer review](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_peer_review)), enable students to become active and self-sufficient parts of the research and scientific community via the sole utilization of [open-source software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source) and [open educational resources](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_educational_resources), as well as increasing the [diversity and inclusivity of science and academia](https://www.psychologicalscience.org/observer/words-to-action) via the diminution of hurdles and barriers: science by everyone for everyone in an open and welcoming manner.

As you can see in the `TOC` on the left sidebar, there’s quite a bunch going on here. You may ask: “Oh my, is all of this really necessary?”. Well, it might depend on who you ask but this course and the people conducting it think so and here’s why: creating a structured and holistic way to empirically train students via a complex framework needs time, effort, details, and dedication. Additionally, to increase openness and sustainability, and thus ultimately the success rate of projects, these things need to be prepared and supplied in a way that is findable, accessible, interoperable and re-usable ([FAIR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FAIR_data)) for as many people as possible.
This course is therefore designed to provide only `FAIR` content and materials.

You can use the following sections to navigate through the content of the lecture:

* [Overview & procedure ](https://peerherholz.github.io/EXPRA_Winter2021/overview.html)

   What's this course all about? How are things implemented and supposed to work? 

* [General outline](https://peerherholz.github.io/EXPRA_Winter2021/outline.html)

   What are the specific topics and aspects taught?

* [Course setup](https://peerherholz.github.io/EXPRA_Winter2021/setup.html)

   What do I need to follow and participate in the course?

* [An introduction to the scientific method & theory building](https://peerherholz.github.io/EXPRA_Winter2021/introduction/introduction.html)

   All things gotta start somewhere and working on a research project is no exception to
   that, but how?

* [Experimentation](https://peerherholz.github.io/EXPRA_Winter2021/experimentation/experimentation.html)

   How to set up and conduct experiments to acquire data from participants and subsequently analyze it? 

* [Project finalization](https://peerherholz.github.io/EXPRA_Winter2021/finalization/finalization.html)

   How can you successfully generate insights from your obtained results and communicate those sufficiently? 

* [Student projects](https://peerherholz.github.io/EXPRA_Winter2021/projects.html)

   Making sure the work and progress of the participants is transparent and
   documented.

* [Questionnaires](https://peerherholz.github.io/EXPRA_Winter2021/questionnaires.html)

   Was it worth it and how can this be evaluated?

* [Code of Conduct](https://peerherholz.github.io/EXPRA_Winter2021/CoC.html)

   Necessities for creating an open, fair, safe and inclusive learning
   experience.

## I've got a question!

In case you have any questions or difficulties with the lecture and its materials, please don’t hesitate a single second to get in touch. A great way to do this is to [open an issue](https://github.com/PeerHerholz/EXPRA_Winter2021/issues) on the
GitHub site of the course. Every feedback or idea or you might have is also highly appreciated and valued.
