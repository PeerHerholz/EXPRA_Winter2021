# Introduction I

Within the first session we'll spend a fair amount of time on talking about the structure, content, goal and implementation of the course to hopefully answer most of your questions and set the stage for the subsequent meetings! This will also entail an introduction section to get to know the folks around you. Additionally, we'll have a short session on `knowledge` and the `scientific approach` to generate and interpret it, obviously with a focus on `psychology`.  

## Topics 💡👨🏻‍🏫 

In the following you'll find the `objectives` and `materials` for each of the topics we'll discuss during this session.

## tasks for subsequent meeting 🖥️✍🏽📖

Below you'll find the tasks you should spend a look at for next week's session.    

### re-cap R lectures

Please go through the `R lectures` you took part in during the last semesters again, just to
refresh a few things. They're linked in [Syllabus section](https://peerherholz.github.io/EXPRA_Winter2021/overview.html#syllabus-and-text) of the [overview page](https://peerherholz.github.io/EXPRA_Winter2021/overview.html). 

### install software

Please go through the [setup page](https://peerherholz.github.io/EXPRA_Winter2021/setup.html) and install all software (or equivalents) you don't already have on your machine so that we can dive right into research work next time.

### optional/reading/further materials

Regarding our topics on `sources of knowledge`, you could watch the debate between Bill Nye & Ken Ham and **critically* evaluate the reasoning, approach and logic of the presented arguments.
