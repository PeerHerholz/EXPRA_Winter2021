# Introduction II

Within the second session we'll spend a fair amount of time on talking about `project & data management` as the necessary prerequisite for any successful research work, specifically with a focus on `open & reproducible science` as well as `FAIR` principles. Additionally, we'll have a shorter session on the `demo experiment` where we will gather your impressions & feedback and furthermore talk about the `background`, `idea` & `aim` of it. 
## Topics 💡👨🏻‍🏫 

In the following you'll find the `objectives` and `materials` for each of the topics we'll discuss during this session.

### Project & data management
As said last session: research is hard and super complex. However, it's worse without clear `outlines`, `documentation` and `standardization`. What are important steps of the `research process` & how should they be documented? At what point do I need think about incorporating `open & reproducible science`? Are there tools & resources I can use? All these and more questions will be addressed in this session.   

#### Objectives📍
- learn about aspects of project & data management 
- get to know respective tools & resources
- Ask and answer questions
- Have a great time

#### Materials📓

### Information about the demo experiment
After taking part in it, it's finally time you learn more about the `demo experiment`. This will entail, some `background information` about the research field we will be working in, i.e. `music/auditory cognition`, the `paradigm` we will be using and the `aim` of the `demo experiment`.

#### Objectives📍
- review of the demo experiment
- learn about the demo experiment
- form demo experiment groups
- Ask and answer questions
- Have a great time

## Demo project related work 🥼🧑🏽‍💻🧑🏾‍💻  

Closely follow the `session` that focuses on the `demo experiment` to learn more about it. Next session we will start analyzing the acquired `dataset` and you'll start implementing the things we talked about, including `OSF` projects, `shared libraries`, `data management plans` and `pre-registration`, as well as start working on the `demo experiment reports`. 

## Project related work 🥼🧑🏿‍🔬👩🏻‍🔬

Not applicable, as project related work didn't start yet.

## tasks for subsequent meeting 🖥️✍🏽📖

Below you'll find the tasks you should spend a look at for next week's session.    

### check demo experiment literature 

Please go through the articles relevant for the `demo experiment` which are collected in the respective [zotero group](https://www.zotero.org/groups/4476011/expra_winter_term_2021_demo_experiment). It's not that crucial to go through everything in detail and you can definitely skip the in-depth math parts. The basic idea is to provide you with more context about the framework and idea, as well as a starting point for your own library. However, it would be important to at least go through [Kriegeskorte & Mur (2021)](http://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2012.00245) and [Kriegeskorte & Kievit (2013)](http://doi.org/10.1016/j.tics.2013.06.007) as these publications are central regarding the `paradigm` we are using.

### check literature for scientific reading & writing section

In preparation for our `scientific reading & writing section`, please go briefly through [Mensh & Kording (2017)](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005619).
