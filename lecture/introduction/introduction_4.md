# Introduction IV
Within the fourth session we'll have two topics, including both theoretical and practical aspects. At first, we'll go start going through the basics of one of the major parts of science & academia: `scientific reading and writing`, specifically `finding/organizing` & `reading scientific publications`. Next, we'll continue to analyze the data acquired within our `demo experiment`. This time, we'll try to dig deeper into the data structures and try to gather data of interest, transforming it to a more intelligible format.   

## Topics 💡👨🏻‍🏫 

In the following you'll find the `objectives` and `materials` for each of the topics we'll discuss during this session.

### Scientific reading & writing I - finding/organizing & reading publications
Sure y'all searched for papers and subsequently read them before, you of course have some idea how to do
these things. However, it can perhaps be improved through various guidelines and tools/resources and this is exactly what we will discuss in this part of the session. You may ask: "why?". Well, for lots of reasons. The amount of publish articles increases exponentially since year and an end of this trend appears to be out of sight. Every day more and more publications of various types are out there. Navigating this vast and complex landscape can be cumbersome and frustrating, especially without clear outlines and strategies. Thus, we'll build upon the `project & data management` basics we explored in the last couple of sessions (e.g. reference/citation managers like `zotero`), explore new tools to discover and organize `scientific literature`, as well as discuss some guidelines that might help you to improve your reading strategies and outcomes.    

#### Objectives📍

- Increase efficiency wrt finding/organizing & reading scientific publications
- Explore new ways to find & organize publications
- Get to know guidelines that help improve reading strategy/performance
- Ask and answer questions
- Have a great time

## Demo project related work 🥼🧑🏽‍💻🧑🏾‍💻  

As mentioned above, we'll continue to work on the `demo experiment`. After setting the ground work for the `project & data management` aspects last week, we'll directly apply the contents of the `finding/organizing & reading publications` discussion, as well as further analyze the acquired `data`.  

### finding/organizing & reading publications wrt the demo experiment
Throughout the first part of the session you'll add a few new references to your `demo experiment group`'s `zotero library`. Besides being a good exercise on the topic and good way to explore the tools/resources introduced in the session a bit further, it has the great side-effect of further populating your `zotero library` adding `references` that might be useful for writing the `demo` and `research reports`.    

### Analyses of demo-experiment
After experiencing first nightmares of un`FAIR` data, we'll dive further into things. The plan is to explore the `data` in more detail, try to understand it, gather `data of interest` and transform it to something more `intelligible`.

## tasks for subsequent meeting 🖥️✍🏽📖

### demo experiment

Starting with this session, you should continue to work on things related to your `demo experiment report`, including `finding/organizing & reading publications`, `data management plan` and `pre-registration` outside standard course hours. 

### reading

In preparation for our next `scientific reading & writing section`, please go briefly through the `ten simple rules` paper concerning  `structuring papers`, which you can find in the course `zotero library`.
