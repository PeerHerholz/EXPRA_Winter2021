# Introduction V
Within the fifth session we'll have two topics, including both theoretical and practical aspects. At first, we'll go start going through the basics of one of the major parts of science & academia: `scientific reading and writing`, specifically `reading scientific publications`. Next, we'll continue to analyze the data acquired within our `demo experiment`. This time, we'll try to dig deeper into the data structures and try to gather data of interest, transforming it to a more intelligible format.   

## Topics 💡👨🏻‍🏫

### demo project 

You should continue to work on things related to your `demo experiment report`, including `finding/organizing & reading publications`, `data management plan` and `pre-registration` outside standard course hours. 

### reading
In preparation for our final `scientific reading & writing section`, please go briefly through the `ten simple rules` paper concerning  `reviewing`, as well as the `data management plan` paper. You can find both in the course `zotero library`.
