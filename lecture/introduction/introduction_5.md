# Introduction V
Within the fifth session we'll have two topics, including both theoretical and practical aspects. At first, we'll go continue going through the basics of one of the major parts of science & academia: `scientific reading and writing`, specifically `structuring scientific publications`. Next, we'll continue to analyze the data acquired within our `demo experiment`. This time, we'll try to dig deeper into the data structures and try to gather data of interest, transforming it to a more intelligible format.   

## Topics 💡👨🏻‍🏫 

In the following you'll find the `objectives` and `materials` for each of the topics we'll discuss during this session.

### Scientific reading & writing II - structuring/writing publications
Last week we've explored how to `find` & `organize scientific publications` using various tools and resources and additionally discussed guidelines that can potentially enhance and strengthen your `reading experience` and `behavior`. Now it's time to talk about the opposite: how to `structure` and `write scientific publications`. Bringing everything you've done during a `project` into the condensed form of `scientific publication` is by no means a trivial or unimportant task: efficiently summarizing and presenting your work in an intelligible and logic manner is key. Thus, we'll exploring a few guidelines that can help with this process, especially `structure`, `logic`, `argumentation` and `flow`.     

#### Objectives📍

- Get insights on how to structure/write publications 
- obligatory APA
- Ask and answer questions
- Have a great time

## Demo project related work 🥼🧑🏽‍💻🧑🏾‍💻  
As mentioned above, we’ll continue to work on the `demo experiment`. After setting the ground work for the `project & data management aspects` and `literature review` in the previous weeks, we’ll directly apply the contents of the `structuting/writing scientific publications` discussion, as well as further analyze the acquired data.

### structuring demo experiment report
We'll use the first part of the session to generate rough outlines of your `demo experiment report` by applying the content we'll explore in the `structuring/writing scientific publications` discussion. Besides information on obligatory `APA` formatting you'll also receive more details on how your `demo experiment report` should look like and what it should entail.

### Analyses of demo-experiment
After experiencing first nightmares of un`FAIR` data, we’ll dive further into things. The plan is to explore the data in more detail, try to understand it, gather `data of interest` and transform it to something more `intelligible`.

## Project related work 🥼🧑🏿‍🔬👩🏻‍🔬

Not applicable.

## tasks for subsequent meeting 🖥️✍🏽📖

### demo project 

You should continue to work on things related to your `demo experiment report`, including `finding/organizing & reading publications`, `data management plan` and `pre-registration` outside standard course hours. 

### reading
In preparation for our final `scientific reading & writing section`, please go briefly through the `ten simple rules` paper concerning  `reviewing`, as well as the `data management plan` paper. You can find both in the course `zotero library`.
