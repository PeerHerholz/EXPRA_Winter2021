# Introduction VI
Within the sixth session we'll have two topics, including both theoretical and practical aspects. At first, we'll go start going through the basics of one of the major parts of science & academia: `scientific reading and writing`, specifically `finding/organizing & reading scientific publications`. Next, we'll continue to analyze the data acquired within our `demo experiment`. This time, we'll try to dig deeper into the data structures and try to gather data of interest, transforming it to a more intelligible format.   

## Topics 💡👨🏻‍🏫 

In the following you'll find the `objectives` and `materials` for each of the topics we'll discuss during this session.

### Scientific reading & writing III - reviewing publications
After evaluating/discussing how we can find & organize as well as structure & write publications, we've reached the final chapter (got it?) of our scientific publications-related endeavors (at least in terms of the theoretical input). More precisely, we'll be talking about the `reviewing process` of scientific publications and evaluate guidelines/aspects that aim to help providing `clearly structured` & `constructive feedback`. "Shouldn't that be a given?" you might ask. Well, you'd be surprised and not in a positive way. Additionally, we will address these aspects via `open science` principles, specifically talking about `open peer review`.    

#### Objectives📍

- Learn about review process
- Get to know important review guidelines
- Ask and answer questions
- Have a great time


#### Materials📓

## Demo project related work 🥼🧑🏽‍💻🧑🏾‍💻  

As mentioned above, we'll continue to work on the `demo experiment`. After setting the ground work for the `project & data management aspects`, `literature review` and `demo experiment report structure` in the previous weeks, we’ll directly apply the contents of the `reviewing scientific publications` discussion, as well as further analyze the acquired data.

### reviewing scientific publications wrt the demo experiment
Throughout the first part of the session you'll be tasked to draft `review outlines` for some papers in the `demo experiment group`'s `zotero library`. Besides being a good exercise on the topic and good way to explore the tools/resources introduced in the session a bit further, it has the great side-effect of preparing your `review` of one other `demo experiment group`'s `report`.    

### Analyses of demo-experiment
After experiencing first nightmares of un`FAIR` data, we'll dive further into things. The plan is to explore the `data` in more detail, try to understand it, gather `data of interest` and transform it to something more `intelligible`.

## Project related work 🥼🧑🏿‍🔬👩🏻‍🔬

Not applicable.

## tasks for subsequent meeting 🖥️✍🏽📖

### demo project 

You should continue to work on things related to your `demo experiment report`, including `finding/organizing & reading publications`, `data management plan` and `pre-registration` outside standard course hours. 

This time there's also a precise task: please try to `extract the remaining behavioral data` from the `json` file, i.e. the `ratings` regarding `stimulus familiarity` and `stimulus liking`. Following an approach comparable to the `demographic data` you should be able the obtain the `familiarity` and `liking` for each `stimulus` (`n=20`) and the respective `confidence of the rating`. Once you have the information, please add them to the `participants.tsv` as new `columns` to keep everything as `FAIR` and thus `BIDS`-y as possible.  

### reading
Please go briefly through the `ten simple rules` paper concerning  `reponding to reviews`. You can find it in the course `zotero library`.
